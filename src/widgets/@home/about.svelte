		The Aguipo Global South Journal (AGSJ) is an open access academic online journal managed by the
		ALL UP Academic Employees Union (AUPAEU) of the University of the Philippines Cebu chapter,
		published annually every October. It publishes articles that advance theoretical, empirical, and
		methodological studies focusing on but not limited to decolonial scholarship, destratification,
		democratization of social knowledge production, and social emancipation vis-Ã -vis the lingering
		effects of (neo)colonialism. The journal encourages submissions from Filipino and Global
		Southern scholars in the university and civil society organizations and other institutions that
		discuss conventional scholarship, propose novel ways of understanding current social concerns,
		and foster conversations across disciplines. All manuscripts are double-blind peer reviewed.
		Likewise, AGSJ publishes book reviews, reports, interviews, and commissioned commentaries.

		The journal warmly accepts contributions in both regular and special issues from scholars,

		movements in the Global South with the goal of offering fresh, innovative, and radical ideas
		helpful in the project of epistemological and social emancipation of the peoples of the Global
		South.
