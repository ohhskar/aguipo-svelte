		The Aguipo Global South Journal (AGSJ) is an academic
		journal managed by the ALL UP Academic Employees Union (AUPAEU) of the University of the
		Philippines Cebu chapter. It publishes articles that advance theoretical, empirical, and
		methodological studies focusing on but not limited to decolonization, destratification, and
		democratization of social knowledge production by Filipino and Global Southern Scholars in the
		university and civil society organizations and other institutions. The journal encourages
		submissions that discuss conventional scholarship, propose novel ways of understanding current
		social concerns, and foster conversations across disciplines. All manuscripts are double-blind
		reviewed. Likewise, AGSJ publishes book reviews, reports, interviews, and commissioned
		commentaries.
