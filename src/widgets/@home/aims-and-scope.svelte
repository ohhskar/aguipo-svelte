		AGSJ seeks to publish the most original contributions in the fields of Global South and
		decolonial scholarship. It accepts contributions from scholars, academics, educators, and
		activists that analyze Global South issues from the perspectives of sociology, psychology,
		anthropology, philosophy, political science, gender studies, history, literature, political
		economy, communication studies, theology, and other related fields in the social sciences and
		the humanities. The journal encourages potential authors to submit not only original works but
		also interventions that engage with concrete Global South concerns and their social movements
		with the view of offering alternatives to the current hegemonic (neo)colonial frameworks and
		practices. Undergraduate and graduate students are also encouraged to submit to the journal.
