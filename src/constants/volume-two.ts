			title: 'Interrogating Neocolonial Education: Critical Pedagogy Contra Neoliberal Schooling',
			authors: ['E. San Juan Jr.'],
			abstract:
				'Education viewed as the traditional process of “educing” human potential for critical thinking derives its actual efficacy from historical contextualization. In a colonized formation like the Philippines, unlike industrialized bourgeois polities, schooling was organized to produce regimented subalterns for U.S. monopolies while reinforcing feudal norms. Private landed property limited any attempt at utilitarian, liberal reforms. Colonial education was designed as a modernizing agency serving U.S. imperial needs from 1899-1946. From 1946 to the present, schooling has functioned as a neocolonial instrument of Cold War politics and counterinsurgency schemes. With the worsening crisis of global capitalism in the new millennium, neoliberal ideology was imposed to undermine any radical challenge to the domination of the U.S.-controlled global market and the imperative of capital accumulation. The pandemic crisis has further exposed the hypocrisy of neoliberal claims to promoting democracy via consumerism and media spectacles. Neocolonial schooling serves chiefly to preserve the inequities of a class- divided society lacking any solid technological-industrial base and real sovereignty – the result of total subordination to U.S. hegemony. It is being challenged by a critical pedagogy of “conscientization” aimed at liberating subalterns from a commodifying, alienating system of values and structures of feeling inherited from over three hundred years of colonization.',

				'Post-Cold War Transformations of Global Literary Capitals in the Dissemination and Circulation of Southeast Asian Literatures',
			authors: ['Ramon Guillermo'],
			abstract:
				'Using data from UNESCO’s Index Translationum, the present article hopes to show how inter-lingual translational relations within Southeast Asia and between Southeast Asian countries and the world have changed due to the end of the Cold War. These transformations have turned out to be most obvious in relation to the global literary capitals which have functioned to disseminate Southeast Asian literature on a global scale. The article concludes with some observations on the possible rise of Global South literary capitals as well as the development of a Global South literary canon which these imply.',

				'The Century-Long Engineered Value of the English Language and the Neoliberal Labor in the Philippines',
			authors: ['Mariyel Hiyas C. Liwanag'],
			abstract: `The neocolonial entanglements of the Philippines with the United States, as intensified by globalization, have maintained the status of English as a privileged language in the country. Learning and using English is inevitable in the Philippines, especially due to globalization. People across cultural, linguistic, and geographical boundaries are now closely intertwined with one another due to the advancement in technology and transportation. This research intends to investigate the link between English and globalized discourses of labor. This research asks the question: How is linguistic skill valued within the framework of neoliberal labor? This general question is answered through supplementary inquiries that each represents a site for the production and circulation of such discourses about English: 1) How does the semi-colonial, semi-feudal setup of the Philippines contribute to the construction of the neoliberal labor?; 2) How is the educational policy in the Philippines shaped by the global market historically?
With the pending policies and mindset by the Marcos Jr. administration regarding the English language, further discussion on language policy is significant. This paper will explain the historical creative design of neoliberalism in creating an engineered economic value of English in a Third World country, creative in such a way that it creates an illusion of choice in employment and that it covertly encroaches on our language planning.
