			title: 'Global Pandemic, Duterte’s Plague: A Dispatch from the “Belly of the Beast”',
			authors: ['E. San Juan Jr.'],
			abstract:
				'The hydra-headed pandemic ravaging the planet has worsened the suffering of 110 million Filipinos inflicted by the authoritarian Duterte regime in 2016-22. Unresolved internal contradictions flared up with the crisis of U.S. imperial hegemony to heighten the racialized subjugation of Filipinos in the diaspora with its history of resistance. This in turn catalyzed opposition on various fronts. Despite the anomalous electoral victory of the Marcos-Duterte team, neocolonial-feudal exploitation persists to bedevil social-media revisionism and fascist barbarism completely anathema to the Filipino people’s long, durable history of revolutionary struggle against colonial domination and oligarchic oppression.',

			abstract:
				'From February 1 to 9, 1971, students, faculty, staff, and residents at University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman took over the campus and defended what they called the“Diliman Commune” from brutal police incursions. This article ties together insights from key participants of the barricades with archival accounts and media reports to recover the lessons of the 1971 Diliman Commune from its dominant anti-communist framing as a radical destabilization plot to foment anarchy. Highlighting the voices of the barricades’ participants, this article reclaims the Diliman Commune as a symbol of resistance to the Marcos regime in a period of heightened anti-systemic contestation around the world described by social movement scholars as the Global Sixties.',

				'Decolonizing Racialized Media Scripts in the Global South: Analysis of Sports News Reports From the Philippines and Tweets From Kenyans',
			authors: ['Satwinder Rehal'],
			abstract:
				'In a postcolonial Global South context, representations of race persist manifested through media scripts that subtly deploy White ideological frames. According to Stuart Hall (1990), media deliberately or subconsciously constructs race in a way that reproduces ideologies of racism. Media scripts that deploy White ideological frames are, according to Shawa (2019, 89), “leaving intact the legacies of colonialist world view that is perpetuating a racist discourse within the Global South itself”. On the one hand, ‘Blacks’ tend to be inscribed with assumptions around their physical attributes and athleticism while on the other, persons of South Asian descent are essentialized on certain ‘fantasized’ imaginations (Adam 2015). Informed by a qualitative content analysis of media texts from the Philippines and Kenya, this paper illustrates the perpetuating legacies of colonial mentalities grounded in the civilizing sporting projects of Western imperialism. The paper calls for praxis on decoloniality by reifying the Spirit of Bandung as a broad epistemic concept in offering an opportunity in filling the blind spot for multivalent Afro-Asian epistemic linkages in a new globalist remapping of decoloniality in the Global South.',

			title: 'Pope of the Global South? Toward a Decolonial Reading of the Francis Papacy',
			authors: ['Mar Louie Vincent Reyes'],
			abstract: `The election of Pope Francis in 2013 sent shockwaves throughout the Catholic world. As the first Latin American Pontiff, Francis provides an important lens into how the institutional Church perceives the Global South. Along with his Argentine background before becoming Pope, the study looks at two of Francis’ papal encyclicals (Laudato Si’ and Fratelli Tutti) and one of his apostolic exhortations (Evangelii Gaudium), the Synod of Bishops for the Pan-Amazon region, and other relevant statements and activities to see the scope of the soft power and influence of the Pope over the Global South and beyond. Applying Massimo Faggioli’s understanding of Francis’ global Catholicity and decolonial theory provides the globalization angle of the Holy Father’s discourses. From there, a critical discourse analysis of the texts helps us understand how the Pope shows particular focus on the plight of the Global South. The paper identifies key themes defining the Pope’s decolonial approach to global and spiritual matters: a culture of encounter, acknowledgment of various peripheries, critiques of coloniality and forms of exploitation, and promotion of integral ecology. From these results, the study constructs the framework of a decolonial paradigm to globalization and international relations that clarifies the role of the Catholic Church in the world and fosters greater appreciation of the subjects of decoloniality and international relations among Catholics. Understanding the Global South focus of the Francis papacy provides a model for different cultures, parishes, and communities with ties to the Catholic Church in countering colonial tendencies while promoting a greater connection between religion and the environment.`,

				'The Changing Aesthetic Standard and Affirmative Participation of the Filipina in the Event of Ideal Whiteness and the Commodified Beauty',
			authors: ['Christine T. Cerezo'],
			abstract:
				'The Filipino society’s beauty preferences and conception underwent through several transformations and innovations. The emerging beauty trends, the expanding capitalist cosmetic and skincare market and industry, and our colonial past have largely contributed to the current definition of what is aesthetically likable to the general public. These factors necessitated and pressured the Filipinos to strive for a marketable and conventionally beautiful face. This study examined the conceptions and preferences of beauty among select contemporary Filipina from ages 15 to 30. Further, this illuminates different sociocultural and historical facets regarding Filipina beauty that evokes a dual standard within the society: the cosmopolitan ‘white’ and conventionally attractive mode of beauty, and on one hand, the diverse, inclusive, affirmative and cosmopolitan version of beauty. This study also identified how these women expressed and affirmed themselves in the convoluted capitalist space while being limited by the commodified aesthetics and the existing socio-cultural preferences for physical appearances within society. These women, in this redefined ideal and the capitalist market, are thus agents and active consumers with proactive choice and awareness, not solely as subjects of the beauty culture and its capitalist scheme.',

			title: 'Praxis in the Global South: The Worldliness of Literature and Theory',
			authors: ['Antonette Arogo'],
			abstract:
				'There is a proliferation of works on the Global South and decoloniality in contemporary scholarship, signaling an extension of Third World and postcolonial studies. What theoretical investments are at stake in the choice of terminology deployed in the study of colonial history, identity and nation formation, and globalization? In parsing these conceptual categories, the paper makes a case for Caroline S. Hau’s Necessary Fictions: Philippine Literature and the Nation: 1946-1980 and Neferti Xina M. Tadiar’s Things Fall Away: Philippine Historical Experience and the Makings of Globalization as Philippine interventions in this burgeoning field. These critical works advance what Boaventura de Sousa Santos asserts is the Global South’s rejoinder to Marx’s eleventh thesis: “we must change the world while constantly reinterpreting it” (2018, viii). Hau’s examination of the creative function of literature, both as artform and poiêsis, and Tadiar’s inquiry into the supplementarity of literature as representation in imagining alternatives to the political generate a decolonial praxis in the Global South. The topoi of “excess” in Hau and “experience” in Tadiar serve as bases for the worldliness of literature, enabling the translation of theory into practice that is the persistent challenge to theory as critical-creative work.',
